\section{Inferring steepness}

Steepness is generally defined as the fraction of recruitment from an
unfished population ($R_0$) when the spawning stock biomass is at 20\%
of its unfished (equilibrium) level ($B_0$). Given a functional form
of the stock-recruit (S-R) function $f$, steepness can be tied to the
parameters of that function (at least in the case of the Ricker and
Beverton-Holt (B-H) S-R functions), such that parameters of $f$ can be
expressed in terms of steepness. However, depending on the form of
$f$, the bounds on steepness are different: the Beverton-Holt S-R
function admits steepness values between $0.2$ and 1, while the Ricker S-R
function admits values between $0.2$ and infinity (i.e., recruitment
can increase above $R_0$ at $0.2 B_0$). 

Theory provides some insight into potential life history predictors
for steepness. For example, recruitment variability and natural
mortalityi, $M$, set the lower bounds for steepness \citep{he_2006_prior}.
However, at low recruitment variability and $M$, there is little
information about steepness in these parameters alone. Given an age
structured model, Mangel et al. (\citeyear{mangel_2010_reproductive};
\citeyear{mangel2013perspective}) showed that steepness depends on
growth, fecundity and larval and adult mortality rates, and
\citet{rose2001compensatory} provided evidence that empirical
estimates of steepness follow expectations from life-history theory.
However, given the multitude of assumptions that need to be made for a
node based on theory alone \citep[i.e., ][]{mangel_2010_reproductive}, from
larval mortality schedules to fecundity at age, a theoretical node was
not deemed achievable in the context of fishnets. As an aside, the paper
by \citet{mangel_2010_reproductive} should be understood as an
exercise that provides a mechanistic underpinning for steepness, not a
practically applicable model. 

The most promising avenue for a steepness node within fishnets that
could be used to predict steepness for (almost) arbitrary stocks,
seemed to be an empirical node that related steepness to life-history. The
biggest issue with the empirical node, however, was that 
\citet{myers_1999_maximum} remains the
only data source that spans a range of families and orders.
\citet{shertzer2012spawner} obtained priors for demersal fish, but
only provided an ad-hoc fit of truncated normal and beta distributions
to estimates of steepness from stock assessments, for south-east US
stocks only. They did not provide individual estimates for species.
Other datasets that provide more formally derived (and unbiased)
priors for steepness \citep[e.g., ][]{michielsens_2004_bayesian,
dorn2002advice, forrest2010hierarchical} are too
narrow to inform over a broad enough taxonomic range for an empirical
node.

Given that the range of steepness varies among the B-H and Ricker S-R
functions, steepness estimated from one S-R function is not directly
applicable to the other. This posed a non-trivial problem for the
development of a general purpose prior for steepness. Ideally, the
steepness node should have a method for Ricker and B-H steepness.
However, empirical approaches to the specification of prior
distributions for steepness have generally focused on either one S-R
model (with \citet{michielsens_2004_bayesian} and
\citet{forrest2010hierarchical} being the exceptions).
\citet{myers_1999_maximum} first provided estimates of B-H steepness
for a large number of species and families based on Myers' S-R
database. The estimates were simple transformations of the maximum
lifetime reproductive rate, which was estimated from a meta-analysis
using the Ricker S-R model across all stocks.
\citet{michielsens_2004_bayesian} pointed out that fits of the Ricker
and B-H functions lead to different estimates for the slope at the
origin and different expectations for steepness. The direct
transformation from Ricker model parameters to B-H steepness applied
by \citet{myers_1999_maximum} therefore gives misleading (i.e., overly
conservative) results. Furthermore, there is a potentially strong
selection bias in the study (for managed, Virtual Population Analysis assessed stocks), which
could have further biased results at the 
species level by including only a
biased subset of populations for any particular species.

Nevertheless, short of doing a new meta-analysis of steepness from the
RAM legacy database or other data sources, \citet{myers_1999_maximum} was
considered the only possible starting point for an empirical node in
fishnets. Estimates for US-Canada west-coast rockfish from
\citet{forrest2010hierarchical} were included to improve estimates of
empirical relationships with life-history parameters, as were
estimates for tuna by S.
Harley \citep{harley_2011_steepness}. Although it should be noded that Ricker estiamtes in that case are biased by the erroneous assumption that Ricker steepness is bound at 1.
The reported estimates for the maximum lifetime reproductive rate in
\citet{myers_1999_maximum} made it possible to re-calculate the Ricker
steepness (alongside the somewhat biased Beverton-Holt steepness
reported in their paper). These estimates were then combined with
life-history information in Fishbase \citep{froese_2014_fishbase}
to build a predictive model for
steepness within fishnets. Given the complex relationships between
life-history parameters and their constraints on steepness, a
non-parametric node based on {\tt Brter} was considered the most practical
starting point.

\section{An empirical steepness node}

\subsection{Data: a collated dataset for steepness}

Empirical estimates based on maximum lifetime reproductive rates were
extracted from \citet{myers_1999_maximum}, and both mean B-H and
Ricker steepness were recorded (the latter calculated using formulae
by \citet{michielsens_2004_bayesian}), along with other parameters
reported in \citet{myers_1999_maximum}. These data were augmented with
data from \citet{forrest2010hierarchical} for \emph{Sebastes ssp.} and
estimates from S. Harley for tuna. The combined dataset is available
in the {\tt /data/steepness} directory as
{\tt Myers\_et\_al\_steepness\_extended.csv}. Data at the family level was
also extracted and saved into
{\tt Myers\_et\_al\_steepness\_families\_extended.csv}.


A data node for steepness was implemented, with the data table
returned by:
<<steepness data node>>=

# Source in the package ----
              
source('collate.R')
require(dplyr)

steep <- Steepness$create('./data/steepness')
head(tbl_df(steep))

@

The table can then be merged with a Fishbase data extract to pair
empirical steepness estimates with life-history data. Note that the
Fishbase data are not restricted to species with steepness estimates, rather
the merge is, in SQL terms, a left join onto the Fishbase data:

<<merge data node>>=

# Load the Fishbase data
fb <- FishbaseWeb$read('data/fishbase-web')
# Limit to the 7940 records with both k and linf
fb <- subset(fb,!is.na(k) & !is.na(linf))
# Add an id column for indexing later
fb$id <- 1:nrow(fb)
# Add a dummy row for helping with predictor nodes
# that need to have at least two predictors
fb$dummy <- 1.0

# merge with steepness data
steep_merged <- Steepness$merge(steep, fb)

head(tbl_df(steep_merged))

@

In order to set up a fishnet that that extracts empirical
relationships between steepness and life-history, the merged
Fishbase and steepness data were aggregated at the species level to avoid
multiple, possibly contradictory, life-history correlates with
steepness. Geometric means were used to aggregate life-history
parameters, under the assumption that most follow log-normal
distributions.

<<>>=

# geometric mean
gmean <- function(x) exp(mean(log(x), na.rm=T))

# reduce dataset; gometric means for paramters by species
steep_reduced <- steep_merged %>% 
  select(species, 
         genus, 
         family, 
         class, 
         order, 
         mean_BH_z, 
         linf,

         fecundity,

         lmat, 
         lmax , 
         k, 
         amax, 
         habit, 
         trophic, 
         depthmax) %>% 
  group_by(order, class, genus, family, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_BH_z=unique(mean_BH_z),
            habit=unique(habit),
            trophic=gmean(trophic), 
            linf=gmean(linf),

\subsection{A Bayesian empirical node to avoid over-fitting}

An initial attempt at defining a fishnet based on previously available
nodes ({\tt Brter}: boosted regression trees; {\tt Svmer}: support vector
machines; {\tt Glmer}: generalized linear models) suggested that
over-fitting of empirical relationships might be interfering with
predictive power of the nodes. To investigate this problem,
I implemented a Bayesian node based on the INLA package 
\citep{ru_2009_approximate}. Fully Bayesian
methods are less prone to over-fitting, and the INLA approach, based
on Laplacian approximations, allows for fast parameter estimation in
linear and linear mixed models. The resulting node, called
{\tt Bayser}, uses the same formula syntax as previous empirical
nodes, with an additional option to estimate random effects with the
{\tt f(effect, 'iid')} syntax (e.g., {\tt f(family, model='iid')} for a family
level random effect). This option should facilitate the use of
taxonomic information in empirical nodes, whereas the use of taxonomy
as a fixed effect frequently leads to over-fitting. The {\tt Bayser}
node comes with {\tt fit}, {\tt sample}, {\tt predict} and {\tt tune} 
methods:

<<bayser example>>=
linf=Bayser(log(linf) ~ f(family,model="iid") +
                f(order,model="iid") +
                log(lmax) +
                habit,exp)

# fitting to data
linf$fit(steep_reduced[1:1500, ])
psamp <- 1501:nrow(steep_reduced)

# predicting onto new data
example_predictions <- 
    linf$predict(steep_reduced[psamp, ])

nna_data <- !is.na(steep_reduced$lmax[psamp])

predict_df <- data.frame(bayser=example_predictions[nna_data], 
    observed=steep_reduced[psamp,'linf'][nna_data])

linf_brter=Brter(log(linf) ~ family + 
    order + log(lmax) + habit, exp)

# fitting to data
linf_brter$fit(steep_reduced[1:1500, ])
# predicting onto new data
example_predictions_brter <- 
    linf_brter$predict(steep_reduced[psamp, ])

predict_df <- reshape2::melt(
        data.frame(brter=example_predictions_brter[nna_data],
        predict_df), id.vars=c('observed')
    )

\subsection{Sequential imputing of data in fishnets}

In the {\tt Bayser} example above, {\tt linf} depends on {\tt lmax} in an
empirical node. The relationship can only be estimated for data rows
(i.e., species) with data for both traits. For more complex life
history interactions, missing data for the combination of covariates
in the model can strongly influence the total number of species for
which the relationship can be estimated. For example, one species may
not have a reported von Bertalanffy $k$, while another species may have
$k$ but no estimate of fecundity. Neither row could be included in a
node like steepness, which may depend on both factors. In the case of
steepness, only 46 empirical estimates at the species level are
available from the dataset described above, and missing values
dramatically reduce the number of covariates that could be used to
construct an empirical node for steepness.

To obtain more data for complex empirical relationships, I implemented
an option within the generic {\tt fit} method of a fishnet, which allows
data to be sequentially imputed. Thus, if {\tt linf} depends on 
{\tt lmax}, and {\tt k}
in turn depends on {\tt linf}, then {\tt linf} could be imputed for species with
missing {\tt linf} based on the node relating it to {\tt lmax}. This
allows $k$ to
be estimated for species with data for {\tt lmax} and missing data for
{\tt linf}.
The imputation naturally relies on a linearly evolving net, where
relationships depend on  values imputed at lower level nodes. The
option can be turned on using {\tt impute=TRUE} when fitting a fishnet
(see the steepness node fitting below).

\subsection{The empirical steepness node: fishing for predictive power}

The empirical fishnet node to estimate steepness was embedded in a
larger fishnet that aimed to build a covariate set (using the
{\tt impute=TRUE} option). All empirical nodes leading up to steepness node
itself used the {\tt Bayser} node, and included taxonomic information as
random effects. The actual steepness node was initially specified as a
{\tt Brter} node, in order to capture potentially non-linear relationships
between steepness and co-variates. After some discussion, the B-H
estimates by \citet{myers_1999_maximum} were used as these were deemed most useful
in the context of NZ stock assessments, which typically
use B-H S-R functions.

Even for the best {\tt Brter} model, the jackknifing suggests very low
predictive power (\autoref{fig:output_brter_jk}), possibly due to
over-fitting. To investigate this possibility, the node was

The Bayesian node does not improve predictions
(\autoref{fig:output_bayser_jk}); neither node thus seems to produce
particularly good point predictions for steepness. However no clear
bias seems to be present in the predictions. Predictive error may be
in part due to the somewhat biased estimates of steepness in the input
data, with potentially low-quality estimates for various life-history
parameters in Fishbase further obscuring their relationship with
steepness.

\section{Examples}

The examples follow some examples used in the {\tt bea2014} node, with
additional life history data collected for hoki and snapper from the
MPI plenary \cite{mpi_2014_fisheries}.

\subsection{Information gained from life history: Bluenose}

This example shows how the steepness predictive distribution is shrunk
when life-history information is added to the predictions
(\autoref{fig:bluenose}). The life-history data particularly truncates
the upper end of the distribution, suggesting that steepness values
above 0.9 are not consistent with life-history.

\subsection{Comparing against data}

This section compares steepness estimates from various levels of
life-history information to available data in Fishbase and steepness
estimates by \citep{myers_1999_maximum}. The first two examples are taken
from the {\tt bea2014} fishnet, the other two examples treat NZ stocks
specifically, namely hoki and snapper.

\subsubsection{Atlantic Cod}

Steepness estimates for Atlantic Cod are consistently below the value
estimated in Myers et al., and do not seem to fluctuate much with
increasingly detailed life-history information
(\autoref{fig:Cod1},\autoref{fig:Cod2},\autoref{fig:Cod3}).

\subsubsection{Skipjack tuna}
 
The estimated steepness values are clearly too low given the productivity of skipjack that is assumed in assessments (\autoref{fig:SJ1},\autoref{fig:SJ2},\autoref{fig:SJ3}).

\subsubsection{Snapper}

Life history data were taken from the stock assessment plenary,
Fishbase, as well as individual Snapper assessments. The assumed values
of steepness in assessments are 0.85 and 0.9 for SNA1 and SNA7,
respectively. Steepness is fixed at 1 for SNA2, which assumes that recruitment at 20\% of virgin biomass
is (with 100\% certainty) equivalent to unfished recruitment
\citep{mangel2013perspective}.

<<snapper,fig.cap='Predictions of life-history parameters and steepness from life history data for snapper \\emph{Pagrus auratus}, using distributions as inputs.'>>=

BH_net_test$fit(subset(steep_reduced,
                       species!='Pagrus auratus'),
                impute=T)

preds.snapper <- BH_net_test$sample(dists(

  amax=Fixed(60),
  linf=Normal(65,5),
  k=Normal(0.1, 0.05)), 
  samples=1000)

plot_samples(preds.snapper,steep_merged,
    'Pagrus auratus')
@


The snapper predictions from the Beverton-Holt steepness node seem to
provide sensible estimates (\autoref{fig:snapper}), with a
distribution centered around
\Sexpr{round(mean(preds.snapper$mean_BH_z), 2)},
close to estimates used in the assessments for
SNA1 and SNA7. However, the density near 1 is very low, suggesting
that the SNA7 assumption of $z=1$ is not consistent with life-history
traits.

\subsubsection{Hoki}

Hoki life-history parameters were extracted from the 2012 assessment
of HOK1 \citep{mpi_2014_fisheriesi}. The steepness value in the assessment is 0.75, reduced from
0.9 (used prior to 2008). Estimates from the steepness node suggest
that even 0.75 is at the upper limit of what life history correlates
would suggest (\autoref{fig:hoki}).

<<hoki,fig.cap='Predictions of life-history parameters and steepness from life history data for hoki \\emph{Macruronus novaezelandiae}, using distributions as inputs.'>>=

BH_net_test$fit(subset(steep_reduced,

\section{Discussion}

Examples for B-H steepness for individual species gave reasonable
results for New Zealand stocks, but gave questionable results in the
case of Atlantic Cod and especially skipjack tuna. The latter is
especially surprising seeing that the dataset includes data from an
analysis of tuna stocks. Since the steepness nodes did not produce
high predictive power in jackknife tests, the accuracy of the
estimates in these examples is unlikely to be good.

This document analysed data using biased B-H estimates; a companion
document shows that the unbiased Ricker estimates provide a slightly
better basis for a predictive node. In that case, the {\tt Brter} node
suggested some predictive power, suggesting that the bias in B-H
estimates contributed to obscuring of relationships with life-history
parameters. Estimates for skipjack were also notably improved with the
Ricker S-R data. However, this may have been due to biased estiamtes in \citet{harley_2011_steepness}, which assumed an upper bound of 1 for Ricker steepness.

\subsection{Can the steepness node be improved?}

The biggest improvement for a steepness node would most likely come
from a new meta-analysis of steepness values, using methods outlined
in \citet{michielsens_2004_bayesian}. Since both the data and methods
are available, this avenue holds the most promise for improving
steepness estimates. This could have a substantial benefits for stock
assessments, not just in New Zealand, but elsewhere as well.
Collecting available S-R data over a range of species from primary and
grey-literature, in addition to data available in the RAM legacy
database would be an important part of such an analysis.

An alternative to using meta-analysis estimates to inform an empirical
node would be to perform simulations based on theory
\citep{mangel_2010_reproductive, mangel2013perspective}, with species
for which sufficient data are available. This subset is probably small,
and the simulations would require assumptions about
larval and early-juvenile survival, however they could
give consistent priors for both Ricker and B-H S-R functions.

\subsection{Suggested developments for fishnets}

Suggestions relating to packaging and ensuring code integrity in the
open source context:

\begin{itemize}

\item The code is still somewhat cryptic, and the proto-type object
structure will be difficult to digest by potential users that are
more familiar with the classical R object systems such as S3 and S4.
The proto approach has its advantages, and writing some good
documentation, along with a vignette that explains the object system,
would be a good way to make the package more accessible. The
documentation would, I imagine, be somewhat more difficult given that
packages like {\tt roxygen2} or others used for R documentation do not
integrate automatically with this structure. 

\item Distributed development can easily lead to modifications by one
developer breaking code that others are working on. Having a testing
and deployment routine that involves tests over all main features in
fishnets would be extremely helpful and could be considered part of
the package, so package builds fail if tests fail (and pull
requests should not be accepted if the package does not build
successfully). The {\tt testthat} package would be 
an ideal way to achieve this.

\end{itemize}

Other suggestions:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fully Bayesian outputs from the prediction process (i.e.,
posterior predictive distributions as priors from the {\tt Bayser} node),
which would provide more consistent priors in a strict Bayesian sense.

\item A hierarchical model parser, which would take a linear fishnet
(i.e., the graph) and transform it into a Bayesian hierarchical model.
The fully Bayesian approach has the advantage that estimation and
predictions would be consistent over the whole graph, with
likelihoods at one level of the graph conditional on information
at other levels. 

\end{itemize}
